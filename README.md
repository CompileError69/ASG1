A list of User Stories:
- As a person who recently got into weightlifting, I want to purchase weights and equipments so that I can eventually have my own well equipped home gym.

- As a person who is of old age, I am not as tech-savvy as my younger counterparts. But I decided to take this opportunity to explore and learn how I can purchase items online, since I am currently looking for some sports wear. I decided to buy from this website to get what I want, and at the same time, familiarise myself on how I can navigate myself and purchase products online.
